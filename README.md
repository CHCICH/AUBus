Welcome to AUBus Ultimate:
Project for EECE 351 by Ali Sobh - Charbel Haddad - Ali Abdul Sater

To run the application please do the following:
Navigate to the \backend folder and run static_gateway.py
After that, please run on a different terminal p2p_server.py
Now to activate the app, please exit the folder and enter the \frontend folder and run the gui.py file on a different terminal.

Voila!

If you want to have 2 gui.py open at the same time (one simulating the Passanger and the other simulating the Driver) you can do so! After running and keeping on static_gateway.py and p2p_server.py, please run gui.py twice (open on different terminals)


The full documentation of the code is present in the PDF report.


Thank you !! :)
